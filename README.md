# Employee-Attrition-Analysis Dashboard (Tableau) 

## Introduction:

This is a Tableau dashboard project based on employee attrition data. It involves deep-diving into HR records to analyze which types of employees are leaving the company and the reasons behind it. Various factors like job level, overtime, travel frequency, salary, and satisfaction were visualized to uncover key attrition patterns.

## Business Problem

In this project, the IBM employee dataset was used to analyze high attrition rates within the company. Frequent employee exits were leading to significant losses in training costs, salaries, and workflow disruptions. Replacing talent was expensive and time-consuming, requiring additional onboarding and training efforts.


## Goal of the Dashboard:
The main goal of the project is to uncover who are leaving the company, what is the reason behind them leaving, are there any specific factors which are leading to their churn and also provide them data-backed suggestions to reduce the churn.

## Tools Used and Concepts:
Tableau:  Data Analysis and Data Visualization.

## Insights Derived:

1) 50% of young employees (18–25 age group) in junior roles left the company, pointing to a lack of growth, low salaries and lack of career support.

2) 31% of employees who worked overtime and 25% of those who traveled frequently showed higher attrition, showing poor work life balance and stressful environment and the people who churned showed more overtiming percent.

3) Most of the employees (age 40+) are still in the junior job levels indicating no promotions and low career growth signs.

4) 37% of employees gave low job satisfaction ratings (1–2 stars), maybe due to people are working hard but they are not getting appreciated/recognized for their work may that be in salaries or promotions.

5) 56% of R&D employees and 39% of Sales employees left the company, compared to just 5% in HR, showing attrition is highly uneven across departments.

6) Most of the employees are even the senior employees are having no equity or very low equity in the company which can lead to churn where the employees will switch to another companies offering better long term incentives and financial benefits.

## Business Impact:
1) Identifying 50% attrition in young junior employees helped the company redesign the early-career support and reduce future rehiring needs.

2) Spotting 31% attrition among overtime workers and 25% in frequent travelers led to changes in workload and travel policies that reduced burnouts.

3) Finding that 30% of senior employees were stuck in junior roles helped flag promotion issues and improve career growth for proffesional individuals.

4) Revealing that 37% gave low job satisfaction ratings helped justify new recognition and engagement programs to boost worklife balance and retention.

5) Highlighting high attrition in R&D (56%) and Sales (39%) focused leadership attention on stabilizing core teams critical to product and revenue.

6) Noticing low or no equity among most employees, including seniors informed discussions on long-term incentive plans to improve retention of key talent.
